2022-07-07 - 0.7.8 - Final release

- Fixed bug where the event overlay won't work when completing an RPG/ITL song in Waterfall environment
- Added reload songs menu from the song select screen (ITGmania only)

With the release of ITGmania, my vision for Waterfall Expanded is to continue to support all features in a way that it is a single theme download for all Stepmania/ITGmania releases. Given that ITGmania has been released and is now in active development, I simply don't have time to continue developing on the vision I have for it. I have added the quick reload songs feature to the songwheel (ITGmania only), but none of the other ITGmania-specific features will be functional in WFE (you will still have to run this with groovestats launcher)

With that being said, this is the final release of Waterfall Expanded from me.

Thank you everybody who showed interest in Waterfall Expanded by using it and/or contributing ideas/code to the theme. It was a lot of fun and a challenge to keep up with events while implementing a lot of the ideas I had for theming. If anybody would like to take over the development, please feel free. I'd be happy to help if you need. 

And of course, thanks to SteveReen for Waterfall, a great theme and I can't wait to see what you've got cooking up!

2022-06-17 - Minor Tweaks. No version number change here

- ITGmania support, but it does not have support for any of the new ITGmania features. You will still need to run through GS Launcher.

Changelog

2022-04-28 - 0.7.6.2 - ITL QoL + stuff

This was just supposed to be only the ITL songwheel points bar thing but there were a lot of errors so it took a while. I had a lot of code shared to me by other people recently, so I put all of that in too.

New Player options:
	- Column cues to show an upcoming mine/arrow. Mainly to tell Kigha there's a left arrow mine at the start of [12] SHUM (but she'll still hit it).
	- Offset Display in milliseconds to show dimo just how tight his timing is.
	- Effect/Accel/Appearance mods are back in under the "Fun Options" menu.

ITL/EX scoring changes:
	- Bars to display your ITL points/EX score/bonus on the songwheel
	- Points earned on the evaluation screen
	- EX Score is shown on the WF pane
	- When EX Scoring display is on, evaluation screen will always show the EX score instead of doing the flash every few seconds
	
Other:
	- Outfox support without having to modify files
	- "New profile" bug should be fixed
	- Groovestats score box should no longer crash occasionally 
	- Keyboard features theme option is now required to be enabled to use Ctrl+R quick restart
	- When there is only one difficulty for a given song, the songwheel will display the score for that difficulty regardless of what difficulty is currently selected

Thank you very much to Daikyi, Jewel, teejusb, and Zankoku for various contributions to this release <3

Note for ITL score bars:

The point values may not 100% accurate because prior to this release, we did not track best EX score.
If you are having problems with song rankings and point values, make sure you download the latest ITL song patches, and delete the cache for the ITL directory
You can separate your ITL songs by difficulty, just make sure the folder names contain "ITL Online 2022", e.g. "ITL Online 2022 [07]" will work
If you are still having problems with the ITL song wheel or have any questions about it, ask in ITC discord #themes / DM me or Daikyi on discord

---------------

0.7.6.1 - Bug fixes
This is a small update to correct some of the problems due to a rushed release of ITL.

- Overhauled Subtractive Scoring. "Subtractive Scoring environment" now available. "Default" will choose EX score if enabled, and whatever your environment is if not.
- EX Score display on reverse scroll positioning fixed
- Evaluation screen will now always show the EX score regardless of if you turned EX score on or not
- Everything in course mode *should* work now.
- LotusFlower now has an ITG environment font, thanks mute!

---------------

0.7.6 - ITL 2022 update with some other stuff

Additions
- "Keyboard features" theme option. You will need to enable this to enable song search.
- Added all functionality required for ITL2022 launches, including EX scoring system, GS submission, leaderboard, and EX scoring
- Added Score Pace to subtractive scoring options to show the score you are on pace to get. Useful particularly in long bois.
- Included RAKKII's new judgment fonts

Changes
- Switched the GS box to the SL 5.1.0 version (thanks teejusb!)
- Measure counter no longer overlaps text
- Header now inherits screen darkening setting
- Screen Darken is now a number from 0 (off) to 1 (fully dark). Old values were Dark = 0.5, Darker = 0.75, Darkest = 0.95
- Fixed incorrect counts on the evaluation screen if you keep playing after ITG failing.

Notes:

I didn't have a lot of time to get the ITL things across the board, so there are a few things related to EX scoring and the leaderboard
that won't work as expected, but they are very minor and may not even get noticed. I should hopefully fix it by the time it matters.

Evaluation music has been changed and requires different naming convention now

I changed the way the Evaluation screen music works. I haven't included a music file, but if you add one in, you will need to change the filename.

If you want separate sounds for pass/fail, put the files into your Sounds directory under the names:

ScreenEvaluation passed.ogg
ScreenEvaluation failed.ogg

If you just want a single file for both pass and fail, name it 

ScreenEvaluation both.ogg

If you want it to loop, add (loop) into the filename e.g. ScreenEvaluation passed (loop).ogg. If none of these files exist, it will just play nothing.

Thank you SteveReen for making Waterfall. This version was originally intended to just be the base with a few QoL and fun changes. The changes added up fast so I thought I might as well release something if people want to use it.

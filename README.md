_This project is currently maintained by **sukibaby** and **rehtlaw**. We'd also like to thank everyone who contributed to Simply Love / Waterfall, especially as several features from Simply Love are being backported into this theme._

_This theme is specifically geared towards supporting the current build of ITGmania. It may still work on StepMania 5.0.12 / 5.1.0b2 / other SM5 forks to varying degrees, but we aren't testing those platforms._

_zarzob's Waterfall Expanded 0.7.8 can be found in the `original-wf-expanded-0.7.8-by-zarzob` branch._
